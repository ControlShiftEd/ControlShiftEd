I've always been interested in technology. In computers and
coding, to be more specific. My first experience with computer
programming was in high school, where I learned some Visual Basic
and some HTML. You can picture a grade 10 boy at the back of the
class, not listening to a word from the teacher, hacking away at a
computer and recreating basic games like Pong and Pacman. I also
made some fan websites (they were never hosted, nor did I keep
them) for some of my favourite video games. Yep. I was THAT nerd.
I'm pretty sure I only got a good grade in that course from
helping my classmates finish their own projects. And at that time,
knowing how to code or program wasn't "cool".

And yet, I am not a computer programmer. I am not a software
developer, nor an engineer. Nope. I am a middle school French &
Science Teacher. I didn't go down that route as my grades in Math
weren't strong enough at the time. In fact, my appreciation and
love for programming took up so much of my time that my grades in
other subjects started to suffer. As any responsible parent would,
my parents stepped in and steered me away from programming. Little
did they know at the time, or I, that software development would
become such a desirable field. In hindsight, I'm sure they would
have done things differently. Now, I code on my free time, make
scripts that take more time to create than it actually saves, and
teach my students the basics of Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I occasionally reconsider my career path. When I get an itch to
code, I follow some online courses and create personal projects
for myself, like this one.

ControlShiftEd is a passion project, an amalgamation
of side projects to make educators, and the general population,
more knowledgeable about computers, software development and
technological literacy. The goal is to share my knowledge, my
discoveries, and my tools with you. I hope this ripples into a
self-interest for you to learn about concepts yourself. I believe in the power of Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS) to get it done. What better
way to learn about something than when it's freely available to
use and explore? Grab a pen and paper, a notebook, open up your favourite text
editor, and let's learn together! 

There are plenty of things I want to do and
show off down the pipeline. I hope I have the time and energy to
accomplish them all. In the meantime, feel free to peruse through
my notes and other projects I've developed!
